### MPAMV - More Precise Amazon Music Volume (Slider)

A simple userscript to reduce the stepping on Amazon Music from 0.1 to 0.01 (so you can tune in increments of 1% rather than 10%).

#### How do I install this?

Install [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/) or [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) and then [**click here**](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mmjee/more-precise-amazon-music-volume/master/userscript.js).

#### How did the Amazon Music people, famously part of the FAANG society not think of this?

I don't know, the FAANG people only target the bottom barrel people who have no sense of precision anyway.
