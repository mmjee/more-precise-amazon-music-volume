### MPAMV - More Precise Amazon Music Volume (Slider)

A simple userscript to reduce the stepping on the Amazon Music volume slider from 0.1 to 0.01 (so you can tune in increments of 1% rather than 10%).

#### How do I install this?

Install [Violentmonkey](https://violentmonkey.github.io/) or [Greasemonkey](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/greasemonkey/) and then [add this to your userscripts](https://github.com/mmjee/more-precise-amazon-music-volume/raw/master/userscript.js).

#### How do I use this?

1. Open the volume slider and press ALT + V (_ALT_ernate _V_olume).
2. Profit? (Or perhaps world domination)

#### How did the Amazon Music people, famously part of the FAANG society not think of this?

I don't know, the FAANG people only target the bottom barrel people who have no sense of precision anyway.
